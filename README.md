# forza-horizon-5-telemetry-listener
Telemetry Listener in Python for Forza Horizon 4 and Forza Horizon 5

## Requirements

You need an Oracle Autonomous JSON Database to run this and need access to the wallet credentials. You will need to download the database's wallet and replace the contents of [the wallet directory here](./wallet) with your information. I also recommend modifying your own sqlnet.ora to also include the final directory of the wallet. This depends on where you're trying to execute the code. If you're trying to use [this present Dockerfile](./Dockerfile), you can simply edit it to:

```
DIRECTORY="/home/appuser/wallets/Wallet_forza"
```

but in case you're planning to execute manually in your own computer, you'll need to include your wallet's location in your own computer.

Additionally, to be able to connect to the database securely, you'll ned a username, password and DSN. All this information shall be inside a config.yaml file. You will need this structure:

```yaml
db:
  username: xxxx
  password: xxxx
  dsn: xxxx
WALLET_DIR: directory_for_wallet_uncompressed
```
where WALLET_DIR parts from your $HOME directory. Works in both Windows and UNIX OS's. For example, if your wallet is located at /home/your_username/wallets/my_wallet, then WALLET_DIR should be:

```yaml
WALLET_DIR: wallets/my_wallet
```

After having the database credentials as well, you're good to go.

## I don't have an Autonomous DB, what can I do?

Don't worry. If you sign up for Oracle Cloud you can create an Always free Autonomous DB with 1 OCPU and 1TB storage for free **FOREVER**. 

## How to Run

### Manually

To only log data in a race, 
```
python listener.py --verbose --mode "race"
```

To log all data, whether or not in a race,
```
python listener.py --verbose --mode "always"
```

### Using Docker

First, you will need to build the image.

```
docker build --pull --rm -f Dockerfile -t fh5 .
```

To only log data in a race, 
```
docker run -p 65530:65530/udp --rm fh5:latest --verbose --mode "race"
```

To log all data, whether or not in a race,
```
docker run -p 65530:65530/udp --rm fh5:latest --verbose --mode "always"
```
